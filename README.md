All credit goes to the author of that extension, I just updated it.

To install (before this gets on the chrome web store,) clone the repository or download [here](https://codeload.github.com/Krucifixa/torrentz2-magnet/legacy.zip/master), unzip, enable developer mode in chrome extension settings, Load Unpacked Extension, and select the folder.
