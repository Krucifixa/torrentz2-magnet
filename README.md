All credit goes to the author of that extension, I just updated it.

To install (before this gets on the chrome web store,) clone the repository or download [here](https://github.com/blha303/torrentz2-magnet/zipball/master), unzip, enable developer mode in chrome extension settings, Load Unpacked Extension, and select the folder.
